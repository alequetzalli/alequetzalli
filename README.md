### Hola, soy Alejandra Quetzalli 🦄

Because I work for an OSS project, I also have the honor of being deeply involved in Community Building for AsyncAPI.
- 💬 **Ask me about ...** How you can [contribute to the OSS AsyncAPI initiative](https://dev.to/alejandra_quetzalli/how-to-contribute-to-oss-asyncapi-initiative-dh7) and/or our [documentation](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/getting-started). We accept doc PRs from the community too! 😀👍🏽

- ⚡ **Fun fact...** Soy Latina. I was born and raised in México 🇲🇽. I moved to Seattle and got into tech by accident in my mid-twenties and here we are. 
- 🐕‍🦺 **I have a medical service dog...** Her name is Canela! (Spanish for cinnamon.)
- 🧠 **I'm autistic...** I'm neurodiverse, yay! 😁 


### What I do for AsyncAPI Docs ✨✨
- Own the docs for the AsyncAPI feature set— documenting this specific area of our Open Technologies function and driving all docs efforts around it.
- Plan documentation in conjunction with OSS community feedback— working with open-source communities to learn about a feature from specifications and user research.
- Collaborate closely with Developer Relations to ensure docs and learning materials align with community needs: this includes assisting with AsyncAPI documentation, tutorials, and other education efforts within Open Technologies.
- Conduct editorial reviews on my teammates’ and community doc drafts— providing constructive and kind feedback that helps colleagues to grow.
- Liaise with stakeholders across the AsyncAPI Initiative to establish and address docs needs.
