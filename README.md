Quetzalli's approach to engineering documentation inspired her to coin the new term "**docs-as-ecosystem**." 

She believes that "docs-as-ecosystem" represents a more comprehensive and collaborative approach to documentation development than "docs-as-code" because it recognizes that documentation is more than just code. Docs involve technical writing, design, community feedback, community management, accessibility, SEO, UX, and today… even Artificial Intelligence tools! The word ecosystem promotes a paradigm where documentation is treated as a complex and dynamic system that must be managed and nurtured.

Here are some reasons for software communities to adopt the "docs-as-ecosystem" model:
1. **Proposes a holistic, multidisciplinary, and community-centered approach:** The term "docs-as-ecosystem" recognizes that documentation is not just a set of markdown files or code snippets but an ecosystem that needs to be managed and nurtured. The term "docs-as-code" has been widely adopted recently, but it may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of documentation development. The term "docs-as-ecosystem" aligns with the industry trend towards a more holistic and community-centered approach to documentation development.
2. **Encourages collaboration:** The term "docs-as-ecosystem" acknowledges that documentation development involves different roles and stakeholders, such as technical writers, designers, developers, community members, and beyond. By adopting this term, the software developer community can encourage collaboration across diverse stakeholders and facilitate the creation of high-quality documentation.
3. **Emphasizes the importance of retrieving and incorporating community feedback:** The term "docs-as-ecosystem" highlights the importance of retrieving and integrating community feedback in documentation development. It recognizes that documentation is about providing information and meeting community needs and preferences.
