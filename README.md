### Hola, soy Alejandra Quetzalli 🦄

- 📖 **I'm the upcoming author** (2022) of the book titled _"Designing Developer Documentation as a Product,"_ which will be published by the [Apress Publishing Company](https://www.apress.com/us). 
- 📄 **Working on ...** I’m the primary owner of **AsyncAPI Dev Docs and Education** 👩🏻‍💻 , hired by [Postman](https://www.postman.com/alejandra-quetzalli) to focus solely on the Open-Source (OSS) [AsyncAPI initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/). Because I work for an OSS project, I also have the honor of being deeply involved in Community Building for AsyncAPI.
- 👊🏽 **I'm a member of the AsyncAPI Technical Steering Commitee (TSC)...** The [Async API TSC](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) is responsible for the oversight of the AsyncAPI Initiative. The TSC helps make decisions on a higher level, or when maintainers cannot find a consensus. Maintainers (i.e. committers) can make decisions at a repository/project level.
- 💬 **Ask me about ...** How you can [contribute to the OSS AsyncAPI initiative](https://dev.to/alejandra_quetzalli/how-to-contribute-to-oss-asyncapi-initiative-dh7) and/or our [documentation](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/getting-started). We accept doc PRs from the community too! 😀👍🏽
- 👩🏻‍🤝‍👩🏽 **I’m looking to collaborate on ...** [AsyncAPI Docs](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/getting-started) and Learning materials! 
- 📫 **How to reach me ...** My DMs are always open in both [Twitter](https://twitter.com/QuetzalliAle) and [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandra-quetzalli/). 
- ⚡ **Fun fact ...** Soy Latina. I was born and raised in México 🇲🇽. I moved to Seattle and got into tech by accident in my mid-twenties and here we are. 
- 🐕‍🦺 **I have a medical service dog ...** Her name is Canela! (Spanish for cinnamon.)
- 🧠 **I'm autistic ...** I'm neurodiverse, yay! 😁 


### What I do for AsyncAPI Docs and the OSS Community ✨✨
- Own the docs for the AsyncAPI feature set— documenting this specific area of our Open Technologies function and driving all docs efforts around it.
- Plan documentation in conjunction with OSS community feedback— working with open-source communities to learn about a feature from specifications and user research.
- Collaborate closely with Developer Relations to ensure docs and learning materials align with community needs: this includes assisting with AsyncAPI documentation, tutorials, learning, and education efforts within Open Technologies.
- Conduct editorial reviews on my community doc drafts— providing constructive and kind feedback that helps colleagues to grow.
- Liaise with stakeholders across the AsyncAPI Initiative to establish and address docs needs.
