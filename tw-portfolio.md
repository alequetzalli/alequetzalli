# The Basics

## Create a Page

In your sidebar, click the `+` that appears next to the word **Workspace** on hover. A new page will appear. Give it a title and start typing like you would in any other document.

## Headings

You can add headings and subheadings in one of two ways:

- Type `/heading` or `/h1`, `/h2`, or `/h3` to choose the heading size you want.
- Use Markdown shortcuts, like `#`, `##`, and `###`.
    - Create inline code by wrapping text with ``` (or with the shortcut `cmd/ctrl + e`).

## Toggle Lists

- Toggle lists streamline your content. Click the arrow to open.
    - Click the arrow again to hide this content.
    - Create a toggle by typing `/toggle` and pressing `enter`.
    - You can add anything to toggles, including images and embeds.
